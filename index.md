# Magical Tales
## Interactive Fairytales

## About the Project
This program provides the user with interactive audio in response to a story they are telling. Based on specific audio cues, corresponding audio files are played through the program. This includes both a basic version that could be applied to all fairy tales and individualized audio cues for specific tales such as Cinderella and Three Little Pigs.

Interactive Fairytales was created by, and is the intellectual property of, Rucha Dave and Emma Mascillaro. Developed as a final project for Software
Design at Olin College of Engineering, the ultimate purpose of this project was to explore Speech Recognition and practice developing complex architecture with respect to a MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure.

## MVC Design

Our code is separated into three main logical components: Model, View, Controller. Each architecture component handles one of the main aspects of the program.
